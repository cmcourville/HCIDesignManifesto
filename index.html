                        <h2>Design Manifesto</h2>
					</header>
					<article>

					
						<p style="margin-left: 40px">The field of human computer interaction(HCI) is a broad field of study but it focuses on the design and use of computers and technology, specifically the use of computers and technology by humans. This field’s overarching goal is to make the interaction between humans and technology and or computers as similar to human-to-human interaction as possible. Therefore, human computer interaction encompasses and intersects with many disciplines and is the compilation of itself, computer science, human factors engineering, and cognitive science. Those who study HCI go through a design process to create a product, either physical or virtual, which consumers can explore and use with as little difficulty as possible. In order to create with human computer interaction in mind, a purpose of the product must always be evident.   							</p>

						<p style="margin-left: 40px">Throughout each the project iterations, the design process was reflected upon, altered and made better, more tailored to what worked best for me. The first step, however, was always consistent, brainstorming. At this point in time, the purpose for the design was simply “because it is an assignment.” During this first, essential step, ideas are formed and become the offspring of purpose and creativity. All brainstorming ideas must be embraced and given thorough, fair opportunity to be a viable option by which to proceed. I found that writing down, drawing and sketching out ideas when appropriate was the best way to portray a thought and by extension an idea. This step is showcased in project 2: Design for Understanding. Once the ideas were down on paper, the brainstorming session continues by narrowing down the compiled ideas with parameter that are as follows: 
								•	How does this relate to the task at hand?
								•	How much can we expand upon this?
								•	Is it doable and within our skillsets? 
								•	Does this fit within the guidelines of the assignment? 
								•	What will be the message behind this design and can you achieve this goal with certainty? 
								Once you find the idea of best fit, you’ve found your new purpose. The last question in the list of parameters is the focal point. What will be the message behind this design? The answer to this question is what the backbone for the rest of the duration of the design process will be. 							</p>
