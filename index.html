								The field of human computer interaction(HCI) is a broad field of study but it focuses on the design and use of computers and technology, specifically the use of computers and technology by humans. This field’s overarching goal is to make the interaction between humans and technology and or computers as similar to human-to-human interaction as possible. Therefore, human computer interaction encompasses and intersects with many disciplines and is the compilation of itself, computer science, human factors engineering, and cognitive science. Those who study HCI go through a design process to create a product, either physical or virtual, which consumers can explore and use with as little difficulty as possible. In order to create with human computer interaction in mind, a purpose of the product must always be evident. 
								<br><br>
								Throughout each the project iterations, the design process was reflected upon, altered and made better, more tailored to what worked best for me. The first step, however, was always consistent, brainstorming. At this point in time, the purpose for the design was simply “because it is an assignment.” During this first, essential step, ideas are formed and become the offspring of purpose and creativity. All brainstorming ideas must be embraced and given thorough, fair opportunity to be a viable option by which to proceed. I found that writing down, drawing and sketching out ideas when appropriate was the best way to portray a thought and by extension an idea. This step is showcased in project 2: Design for Understanding. Once the ideas were down on paper, the brainstorming session continues by narrowing down the compiled ideas with parameter that are as follows: 
								<br>How does this relate to the task at hand? 
								<br>How much can we expand upon this?
								<br>Is it doable and within our skillsets? 
								<br>Does this fit within the guidelines of the assignment? 
								<br>What will be the message behind this design and can you achieve this goal with certainty? 
								<br>  Once you find the idea of best fit, you’ve found your new purpose. The last question in the list of parameters is the focal point. What do you want your design to portray? What will be the message behind this design? The answer to this question is what the backbone for the rest of the duration of the design process will be. 
								<br><br>
								Can you take a test without paying attention in class? Can you drive a car without having a permit or license? Can you design a product without having gathered as much information on the subject as possible? The answer to all three of these questions is of course you can but the grade of the test will be subpar, lives will be in danger, and a product won’t nearly reach its full potential.  Research on a topic should be extensive, in depth and thorough. Your goal is to know your project, and all that it encompasses, like the back of your hand. Being familiar with a topic and knowing a topic in and out are two different things. It is vital to the success of a product to know what you’re producing, how you can make it better, and what people want to see from it. Extensive research includes looking up: former attempts, reviews and approaches to similar products. An example of extensive research is in the second project, design for others. The project was to redesign a website with a specific demographic in mine. Research was conducted about the Worcester Public Library, special features of the library, what they showcase, what is important to show about a library. Research was also done on the demographic, religious groups. Design decisions were made based on the results of our research from what pages to remake to what color scheme to use on each page. The primary focus during this step in the design process is to better define your overarching purpose of the design and to better define sub-purposes that will guide your, currently just theoretical, decisions with creating the product. 
								<br><br>
								A functional example of what the final product will look like is a great way to show users exactly what you were imagining in during the first two stages of the design process. The purpose of making a prototype is for you the designer to help you visualize what the actual product will be and work out some of the aspects that you struggled with during the previous steps in the design process. It’s beneficial in getting people to sponsor your product in order to show they a physical version of an originally theoretical idea. A functional prototype allots for any ambiguities and confusion to be worked out early in the design process. A good example of a functional prototype would be in assignment 4, design for tension. For this project, a working protype was made of a chatbot. During the creation of the chatbot, my group and I make many changes to the dialog by which to follow in order to better fulfill our purpose of making the chatbot be the most human like as possible. Prototyping is mainly to help visualize the product and analyze the strong and the weak components of your design.
								<br><br>
								How do you know if a product that you’ve designed is good, bad, up to par, or exceeding expectations? Feedback, test runs and user testing interaction. This is where you get to see if people like your design and can use it efficiently. It’s just as important to observe how they interreact with the design as it is to ask them verbally what they thought of the design and how they think it can improve. Most times, a user won’t even realize what they need and what they need to improve for a product and that why observing the interaction is so important. It’s very important during this step to be open minded and to be receptive of the responses and thoughts on the protype. An example of feedback can be best represented in the fifth project, design for wellbeing. Throughout the design process, we asked fellow peers and the professor for feedback on the design and idea behind the website and what they thought we could do to make our design all that better. Feedback has a similar purpose to a protype except the pros and cons on the product come from a third party. 
								<br><br>
								The next step is to integrate, alter and combine the original ideas you had and represented with your functional prototype with the ideas and comments that came from the feedback portion of the design process. Re-prototyping causes the design process to recuse amongst prototyping, feedback, and re-prototyping. This is important because this is how the weaker components get woven out of the final product and replaced with stronger ones. Unfortunately, re-prototyping was the step of the design process that all of my groups struggled with due to only having a week for each project and receiving a new project for which to refocus our attention on. However, had time permitted, alterations would have been made after each demo day and make tend closer to perfection (because no design will be perfect). An important take away from this step in the design process is new ideas on how to improve upon your original ideas. 
								<br><br>
									In conclusion, purpose is interwoven throughout the design process. It guides your decisions and yields a stronger, more affective product. There are multiple reasons for doing that exist in the design process: be it the overall purpose of the project, be the need to acquire more information about a subject, be the need for feedback, or be it the want to design a “perfect design.”
